![Project Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Project Overview

This project is a simple hospital reservation system where users can book appointments for medical services.

## How It Works

- Users enter their personal information (name and email), select the desired date for the appointment, and choose an available time slot.
- Available time slots are displayed based on the selected date and are dynamically updated to reflect the reserved times.
- Once the user submits the form, their reservation is created, and the selected time slot's button changes color to indicate it's been reserved

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js: Frontend framework for building reactive web interfaces.
- HTML/CSS: Basic web technologies for structuring and styling the user interface.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for dynamic interactions and data manipulation
