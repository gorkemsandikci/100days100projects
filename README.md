# 100 Projects in 100 Days

100 Projects - 100 Days it's a classic challenge I'm going to take (and you can join too) starting today (26th July 2023) that it's meant to improve my programming skills by building projects.

# Rules

- Create a project per day
- Share your progress on Social Media (Github, Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, etc) using the #100Days100Projects hashtag
- A project could be: an app, a component, a website, a game, a library, etc
- You can pick what programming language and framework you like
- The project has to be done by 11:59 PM

# Rules for me

- I've created some rules for myself that I don't want to enforce on anyone, but feel free to do the same if you want!

- If I can't complete the project for that day, I will add $5 to my bank account. At the end of 100 days, I will spend all the money for stray animals.

- In this post you'll be able to find a link to all of the projects that I'm going to create

- Anyone is welcomed to join the challenge alongside me! I'm going to be available on discord (#gorkemsandikci) where you can come to share your progress or if you need any help along the way.
