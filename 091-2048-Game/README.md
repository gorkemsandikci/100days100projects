This project is a simple implementation of the 2048 game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play
The game starts on a 4x4 grid with numbered tiles. Players use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the tiles in one direction. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. After every move, a new tile with a value of either 2 or 4 is added to a random empty spot on the board. The goal of the game is to create a tile with the number 2048.
